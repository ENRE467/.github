## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to ENRE467

The course is organized in two parts. The first part uses the TI Maze Runner robot. It exemplifies the programming and testing of low-power computer-driven devices. Such devices are ubiquitous. There are hundreds of them operating in our homes, offices, and cars.

The second part of the course uses the UR3E robotic arm. This is an example of the other robotic extreme. It is controlled by a desk or laptop computer. Energy for the operation of the computer and the arm comes right from the power plug in the wall.

The minicomputer in the TI robot does not have a built in operating system or complier. To program it you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is provided by Texas Instruments in the form of Code Composer Studio, which includes:
    A C/C++ compiler
    A source code editor
    A project build environment
    A debugger
    and a profiler.

To get started, you need to download and install some software on your computer. You can use either a Windows machine or a Linux machine. for the TI robot. You will need a Linux machine for the UR3eE

We will use Github for most of the work on the robot arm (the Universal Robotics UR3). Thus, the frist step in working on the UR3 is to join Github. For instructions on setting up your Github account, please go to https://docs.github.com/en
