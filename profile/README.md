## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to ENRE467

The course is organized in two parta. The first part uses the TI Maze Runner robot. It exemplifies the programming and testing of low-power computer-driven devices. Such devices are ubiquigous. There are hundreds of them operating in our homes, offices, and cars.

The second part of the course uses the UR3E robotic arm. This is an example of the other robotic extreme. It is controlled by a desk or laptop computer. Energy for the operation of the computer and the arm comes right from the pwer lpug in the wall
